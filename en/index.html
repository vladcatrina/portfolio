                I am a web developer who focuses on Javascript. I like building user interfaces and writing
                elegant
                and reusable code. Below, you will find a few projects I've been working on recently. Each of them
                has a GitHub repository and a short video summary, and you can even try out two of them on GitHub Pages.

                            This is a single-page app in which you can keep track of your day-to-day tasks.
                            There are two types of todos: Quests and Trainings. Quests reward experience points, while
                            Trainings increase your level in a certain skill. A Quest can also require a certain skill
                            level to complete. Both types of todos can have a time limit, and the app has a
                            notifications dropdown, where you can view expired todos, as well as those that have less
                            than a quarter of their allotted time left.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The app was built using the Svelte framework. It has no back-end - data is stored in Local
                            Storage. I haven't used other JS or CSS dependencies.

                            This is a website on which you can view football-related data, retrieved from the
                            Football-Data.org API. Data is received in JSON format and transformed by my node.js &
                            express.js app into HTML templates using the EJS templating system. Table components are
                            generated by a single function, which allowed me to derive fields from data objects, and
                            implement pagination. This function returns both an HTML table and a Javascript code that
                            controls pagination, both of these with the help of EJS magic.

                            Each competition, team, match or player can have their own discussion thread on the forum.
                            These threads contain tree-like (recursive) comments. Threads are stored in a MongoDB
                            collection up in the cloud.

                            In this platforming game, a mad scientist is trying to escape his own laboratory, but the
                            lab is infinite, generating a new level each time, out of a predefined list of JSON objects.
                            To avoid obstacles and lasers, the scientist has an ace up his sleeve - he can enable
                            weightlessness - Zero G.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game was made with TypeScript using the Phaser.js engine. The sounds I used are listed
                            in
                            the repo readme. The graphics are my creation, except the character's body, which is a
                            recolored version of the <a
                                href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">body of the
                                character in the Phaser tutorial,</a> and a few menu assets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The framerate problems you see in the video aren't present in the actual game. You can check
                            this by clicking the <a href="https://vladcatrina.github.io/zerog-escape/">GitHub Pages
